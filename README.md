<h2>Tic Tac Toe Game Project</h2>

<h4>Overview:</h4>
The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player strategy game where the objective is to form a line of three of your symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. This project uses the trio of web technologies - HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity - to create a simple yet engaging implementation of the game.
