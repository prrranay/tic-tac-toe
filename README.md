Tic Tac Toe Game Project

Overview:
The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player strategy game where the objective is to form a line of three of your symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. This project uses the trio of web technologies - HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity - to create a simple yet engaging implementation of the game.

Key Features:

Responsive Design:

The game is designed to be responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing and playing experience across various devices and screen sizes.

Interactive Grid:

The game board is represented by a 3x3 grid of cells. Players can click on a cell to place their symbol, alternating turns between X and O.

Winning Logic:

The game logic checks for a winning condition after each move. A player wins if they have three of their symbols consecutively in a row, column, or diagonal.
Game State Management:

The application keeps track of the game state, including the current player's turn, the status of the board, and the winner (if any).

Restart and Reset:

Players can restart the game at any time, resetting the board to its initial state. This feature provides a convenient way to start a new game without refreshing the page.

Implementation Details:

HTML:

Defines the structure of the game, including the grid and any necessary buttons or elements.

CSS:

Styles the game for a visually appealing layout. This includes defining the appearance of the grid, symbols, and any additional styling for buttons or messages.

JavaScript:

Manages the game logic and interactivity. This includes handling player moves, checking for a winner, updating the game state, and responding to user actions.

How to Run:

Open the https://prrranay.github.io/tic-tac-toe/ in a web browser.

Future Enhancements:

Implementing a computer opponent for single-player mode.
Adding animations for a more visually engaging experience.
Customization options for players, such as choosing their symbols or names.
This Tic Tac Toe project serves as a great introduction to web development, providing hands-on experience with fundamental web technologies and basic game development concepts.
